ABOUT
---------------------------------------

Simple website that allows users to search for meetings on a patricular day, and also includes an advanced meeting search on a seprate page. 
The website also has an admin section that allows for certain users to create/delete meetings from the data store.

This is my first attempt using node, and creating an all javascript website.
